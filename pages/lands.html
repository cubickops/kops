  Welcome to yet another amazing section, souls of the Clan! As you may have noticed, we have already quite a few realms related to K.O.P.S. and we thought it would be useful to have all of them listed here so the new (and old) souls don't get lost or miss any of them.
The Killers Of Parted Souls Clan
This is the main clan realm, or the clan lands, as SeleneDiccy once named it (she is a weird person in general, so of course she talks weird too). The Clan Stone used to create the clan, add new members, broadcast messages, etc, is located in the center of this realm.  Points of interest:
1.  "Entrance Hall": SeleneDiccy named this one too. The first things you will notice here are the SIGNS describing the CLAN RULES, the Tip Piggy and the Donation Tables (you can use them if you are feeling generous).
2. Clan Stone Platform: You will find the Clan Stone here, and it is also a good place to orient yourself since it is in the centre of the realm.
3. Fabulous Street: Head north from the Platform. The Leaders' Houses, RULES BUILDING (black coal and pink coral) and Pot o' Gold are located here.
4. Clan Pool: For Pool Parties, Pool Meetings, Pool Events in general or whatever else you need a pool for. You will find it behind SeleneDiccy's House (the dark castle-like, awful building in Fabulous Street) because...well, read the Clan Events section, Pool Parties, to find out.
5. Bouncy Castle: Behind Nanoslime's House. Be careful with it, it is very addictive.
6. Giant Cookie: Not far away from the Clan Pool. We don't really know how or why it is there; just try not to fall in love with it because it is already taken.
7. Clan Theatre: Behind Nanoslime's House and Lady Darq's Bouncy Castle. If you want to know what this building is used for, check the Clan Events section of the Page.
8. Giant Rainbow: Very difficult to spot, the only clue we are going to give you is that it leads to the Pot o' Gold. If you reach the top you can enjoy a nice view.
The Killers Of Parted Souls Shop
This realm has its own section in the page, so we won't say much about it here.
The Killers Of Parted Souls Town
In this realm (still in progress) that resembles a town you will find the houses of the higher ranks of the clan.

The Killers Of Parted Souls Farm
There's not much to say about this realm. It is a farm designed and built (with help) by Nanoslime for the higher ranks of the clan. The reason why only them can use it is because we can't give building perms to every soul; our clan is very big, and if everybody was allowed to build in the farm realm there could be accidents resulting in the destruction of part of the realm (which took a lot of effort and hard work to build), so in order to preserve it we thought it was better to give perms to a few people only. Thank you all for understanding.
