<p>
	Welcome everybody to our new Clan Page. Here you can find some information about The Killers of Parted Souls Clan like who are the leaders, the realms that belong to the Clan and some FAQs.
</p>

<p>
	We, the souls (that's how some of us like to refer to ourselves) of K.O.P.S., are probably the most fabulous (amazing, awesome incredible, unique, WEIRD) people in Cubic World. The Clan Leaders  are a totally insane, unstoppable designer/builder, green slime and a equally insane, hopeless, socially awkward kitty that, for the most part, don't have an idea of what they are doing. Both of them, as well as the clan mods and admins, welcome everybody to join this fabulous Clan.
</p>

<p>
	We hope you enjoy your visit :) Have a nice cubic day!
</p>

	P.D.: Special thanks to Nanoslime for creating the Clan Forum and the entire Clan (actually, he has built most of the Clan Lands himself along with his personal realms, doesn't this guy have a life or what?); Gexgekko for creating the Clan Page and not killing us for nagging him to do it (or killing us for any other reason/fun/sport); SeleneDiccy for redacting most of the texts for the Clan Page (and being the most absolutely fabulous person ever); and BaconGaming for offering his inestimable help, moral support and bacon (big deal, his bacon is his treasure) to our cause.
