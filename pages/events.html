	<h2>We meet again, souls of the Clan!</h2>
	<p style="padding: 2%;">This is the section for Clan Events but, as you can see, we don't have many events to talk about yet. We are working on that, so if you have any suggestions to make, any ideas for events or any kind of meetings you would like us to organize, please feel free to tell us about it (remember, you have our contact information in the Staff section). We will post dates and locations for future events in the Calendar of the Clan Forum (cubickops.freeforums.net) so, please, remember to check that one. For now, we can offer you a bit of information on recurring events.</p>

			Pool Parties

			Captain Obvious once defined this event as a party in a pool. The truth is that it usually consists on just that, and we say usually because we know from experience that this kind of meetings are unpredictable; we have been holding them for ages in SeleneDiccy's Realm, so we know what we are talking about. It is said that the first Pool Party ever was a distraction Gexgekko created to lure people from his realm (where he didn't want anybody) to his sister's; from that day on random people started asking for more Pool Parties in the her amazing Pool, which she had to build specially for that purpose. It is a very easy event to organize since all you need is a pool (there is one in The Killers of Parted Souls Clan realm) and a bunch of people, so if you feel like having a crazy meeting at any given time just tell us and we will help spread the word.

			SeleneDiccy once saw a play written and performed by a fellow clan soul and was so impressed that asked that person to help her build a theatre in the clan so other people could invent stories and act them out there. Nanoslime donated the room where the theatre was built and helped design it along with BaconGaming. If you want to  a play, you will have to show it to us first so we can check that it is "for all publics" (appropriate themes, no swearing, no insulting, etc); if you want to participate in someone else's play as an actor/actress or help them write it, we will try to put you in touch with that person.
