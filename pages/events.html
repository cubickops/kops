  We meet again, souls of the Clan! This is the section for Clan Events but, as you can see, we don't have many events to talk about yet. We are working on that, so if you have any suggestions to make, any ideas for events or any kind of meetings you would like us to organize, please feel free to tell us about it (remember, you have our contact information in the Staff section). We will post dates and locations for future events in the Calendar of the Clan Forum (cubickops.freeforums.net) so, please, remember to check that one. For now, we can offer you a bit of information on recurring events.
