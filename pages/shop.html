<div class="jumbotron" style="text-align: center;">
	<h2>Welcome, everybody!</h2>
	<p style="padding: 2%;">And with everybody we mean not only the souls of K.O.P.S but every player because this is the section for the Clan Shop, which is OPENED FOR EVERYBODY.</p>
</div>

<p>
	The first thing you have to know about the Clan Shop is, of course, how to get there. You can either find the realm (The Killers Of Parted Souls Shop) in the Sky Map or enter through the Shop Building located in the main realm (The Killers Of Parted Souls Clan), south from the Clan Stone Platform. 
</p>

<p>
	The second thing you have to know is what you can buy here. The shop is divided in three sections:
	<ol>
		<li>
			General section: This one is NOT FINISHED yet. We hope we will be able to open it in the future and sell different kinds of craftable items here.
		</li>
		<li>
			Nanoslime's personal section: Here the leader sells his non craftable items.
		</li>
		<li>
			SeleneDiccy's personal section: Here the leader sells her non craftable items.
		</li>
	</ol>
</p>

<p>
	The third thing you have to know, and this is probably the MOST IMPORTANT one, is WHO CAN SELL you the stuff in the shop. ONLY THE LEADERS (Nanoslime and SeleneDiccy) have perms in the shop, so DON'T buy from anyone else. Usually, the leaders can only sell stuff from their own section, which means that Nanoslime can't sell SeleneDiccy's things and vice versa. What they can do, however, is tell the other that you are interested in buying something from their section, so it might be a good idea to let them know.
</p>

<p>
	Well, that seems to be all we can say about the Clan Shop. If you want to buy anything, ask one of the leaders or check the clan forum (cubickops.freeforums.net) for special offers. Thank you all for buying!
