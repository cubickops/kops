		<p>The founder of the clan and one of the leaders. He is a good designer and builder and a bit... weird (those who know him know what i am talking about). If you have any questions you can ask him in game or send him an email, which he will answer as soon as possible. His main realm is Nanoslime's Realm, but he is usually in the Clan Lands.</p>

			SeleneDiccy
		</h3>

	<div class="panel-body collapse" id="selene">
		<p>The second leader of the clan. Her skills are practically non-existent unless you like pain, so how she got the position is still a mistery. If you have any doubts about the clan you can try to find her in the game, send her a friend request and wait for her to teleport to you, or send her an email, which she will answer as soon as possible. She is usually in her main realm (SeleneDiccy's Realm) working on her projects or wandering around the Clan Lands looking for "victims".</p>

		<p>An active Moderator Soul in the clan. One remarkable thing about him is that he loves bacon, very much. He offered to help the souls with their questions, so you if you have any doubt you can ask him in the game.</p>
