	Frequently Asked Questions about the Clan
</h1>
<div class="well well-sm">
	<p><span class="question">Q:</span> How can I join the clan?</p>
	<p><span class="answer">A:</span> If you want to join the clan, first you have to read the rules. You can find them written in signs at the "entrance hall" of the clan (made of glass) right after you enter the realm; you can also access the hall by entering the Rules Building on the realm, which is made of black blocks with a big pink coral "R" on top of it, north of the Clan Stone (you can see it from the platform). After you have read the rules, you have to step on the Clan Stone and one of the leaders will add you to the clan.</p>
</div>

<div class="well well-sm">
	<p><span class="question">Q:</span> Which are the names of the clan ranks?</p>
	<p><span class="answer">A:</span> There are four ranks in the clan (five, if you count the leaders).</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Fabulous Leader</li>
		<li>Admin Soul</li>
		<li>Moderator Soul</li>
		<li>Honored Soul</li>
		<li>Murderous Soul</li>
	</ol>
	<p>  Right after you join the clan you will get the Trial rank. If you relog the Murderous Soul rank will be assigned to you.</p>
</div>

<div class="well well-sm">
	<p><span class="question">Q:</span> How can I be promoted in the clan?</p>
	<p><span class="answer">A:</span> The higher rank you can get is Admin Soul (this means you can't be a leader). You level up by donating (items, cubits, etc), helping out with the clan projects and events, and being an active member in general. If the higher ranks notice that you are actively participating in the clan activities and suggest that you should be promoted, they will all meet to discuss it. After that, they will inform you of their decision.</p>
</div>

<div class="well well-sm">
	<p><span class="question">Q:</span> What is the punishment for breaking the rules?</p>
	<p><span class="answer">A:</span> That depends on what you have done. Every case is different, so the higher ranks will investigate them and decide the punishment accordingly, which can be from a warning, through a demotion, and right up to a ban from the clan.</p>
</div>

<div class="well well-sm">
	<p><span class="question">Q:</span> Can I leave the clan whenever I want?</p>
	<p><span class="answer">A:</span> Yes, of course. If you are not happy being a member of the clan, you can quit it by choosing that option from the Clan Stone menu.</p>
</div>

<div class="well well-sm">
	<p><span class="question">Q:</span> Does the clan have a shop?</p>
	<p><span class="answer">A:</span> Yes, it does. It has a general section, which is not finished yet, and two other sections, one for each of the leaders, where they sell their clothes (hats, wings, accessories, etc) and other non-craftable items.</p>
</div>

<div class="well well-sm">
	<p><span class="question">Q:</span> I am not a member of the clan, can I buy in the clan's shop?</p>
	<p><span class="answer">A:</span> Yes, the shop is opened for everybody, not only for clan members. If you want an item from one of the section, you just have to contact the owner of that section.</p>
</div>

<div class="well well-sm">
	<p><span class="question">Q:</span> I want information on a clan event/project, where can i get it?</p>
	<p><span class="answer">A:</span> We will usually post the information either on this <a href="#events" class="green-line">page</a> or in the <a href="http://cubickops.freeforums.net" class="green-line">forum</a>, but if you still have questions you can always contact the staff (contact information on the <a href="#staff">Staff</a> section of the page) and ask them.</p>
</div>

<div class="well well-sm">
	<p><span class="question">Q:</span> I want to donate items/cubits to the clan, how do I do it?</p>
	<p><span class="answer">A:</span> <span class="green-line">Thank you very much for donating.</span> You can find a Tip Piggy for cubits and a couple of Donation Tables for items in the "Entrance Hall". Please, DO NOT donate to the Clan Stone, it is useless and a waste of your cubits.</p>
</div>

<div class="well well-sm">
	<p><span class="question">Q:</span> If Gexgekko is only the Tech Support of the Clan Page, why does he appear in the pictures instead of one of the Leaders?</p>
	<p><span class="answer">A:</span> There are different theories. Some people believe that he is a very egocentric person and threatened us to let him be the clan image, other people are sure that he is trying to tell us that he knows where we live (and all the places we usually visit) in case we dare upset him; the truth is still a mystery, but most probably a combination of all of the above.</p>
